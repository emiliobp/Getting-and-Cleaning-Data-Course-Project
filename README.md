The run_analysis.R file includes a list of commands that automatically:
1.- Create a folder
2.- Download the data
3.- Read the proper files
4.- Create a tidy data set
5.- Write it on a file

For the successfully execution of the package, please install the following packages with these commands:
install.packages("data.table") 
install.packages("plyr") 
install.packages("dplyr") 

After the proper installation you can move the "run_analysis.R" to your working directory and run it with:
source("run_analysis.R")

A "tidyAggregate.txt" file will be created.
